      <p>Meet Jade Garlick, a seasoned travel professional with over a decade of experience and a passion for exploration. Her journey began with an inspiring European adventure, leading her to defer her Bachelor of Policing to pursue her wanderlust wholeheartedly. </p>

      <p>Joining the Flight Centre Travel Group in 2013, Jade's career soared alongside her adventures. Progressing through leadership roles, from opening a new store to venturing into the luxury domain with Travel Associates, Jade's dedication to excellence only intensified.</p> 
      
      <p>Driven by her love for travel and a commitment to client satisfaction, Jade envisioned a service like no other. Thus, Roast & Roam was born—a luxury agency dedicated to crafting bespoke travel experiences all while sipping on your favourite brew. Her ethos revolves around curating unforgettable moments tailored to each client's desires, filled with insider knowledge and thoughtful advice.</p>
      
      <p>For Jade, it's about more than just booking a trip; it's about providing personalised journeys with surprises along the way. No travel brief is too big or small—she values the trust of each client, promising to be their personal superhero when they're far from
      home. </p>
