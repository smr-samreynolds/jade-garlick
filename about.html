  - review: Jade Garlick organised my trip to Thailand. She was very professional and nothing was to hard for her to organise. Everything went to plan, transfers from airport to hotels and day tours. I would not used anyone else to organise my future trips.

    <p>Driven by her love for travel and a commitment to client satisfaction, Jade envisioned a service like no other. Thus, Roast & Roam was born—a luxury agency dedicated to crafting bespoke travel experiences all while sipping on your favourite brew. Her ethos revolves around curating unforgettable moments tailored to each client's desires, filled with insider knowledge and thoughtful advice.</p>
    
    <p>For Jade, it's about more than just booking a trip; it's about providing personalised journeys with surprises along the way. No travel brief is too big or small—she values the trust of each client, promising to be their personal superhero when they're far from
     home. </p>
