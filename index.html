            I have been fortunate enough to travel to many places in the world over
            the last 12 years. An even bigger stroke of good fortune was finding
            Jade Garlick. Jade has been an absolute asset to all of my travels. She
            has an eye for detail and a nose for a bargain! As the years progressed
            she has become familiar with my preferences and makes suggestions that
            cater to those. Whether it's, air fares, hotels, tours, cruises or co-
            ordination all of the above to create a seamless travel plan anywhere on
            the globe- Jade at Roast & Roam is your "go to" travel person!
            ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

            Jade Garlick organised my trip to Thailand. She was very professional
            and nothing was to hard for her to organise. Everything went to plan,
            transfers from airport to hotels and day tours. I would not used anyone
            else to organise my future trips.

          Jade organised a trip to Vanuatu for myself and two friends and our families! Despite a flight cancellation out of our control, we had the best holiday! Leaving all the travel plans in Jades capable hands took all the stress away! Jade really did go above and beyond for us and was just a phone call away when we had our flight cancelled, my anxiety could have been higher but to know Jade was doing what she could behind the scenes really helped. This is now the 2nd holiday Jade has organised for me, the 1st was Cook Islands, which was another amazing holiday!
