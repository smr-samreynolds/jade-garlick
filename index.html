  - review: Jade Garlick organised my trip to Thailand. She was very professional and nothing was to hard for her to organise. Everything went to plan, transfers from airport to hotels and day tours. I would not used anyone else to organise my future trips.

  - review: Jade organised a trip to Vanuatu for myself and two friends and our families! Despite a flight cancellation out of our control, we had the best holiday! Leaving all the travel plans in Jades capable hands took all the stress away! Jade really did go above and beyond for us and was just a phone call away when we had our flight cancelled, my anxiety could have been higher but to know Jade was doing what she could behind the scenes really helped. This is now the 2nd holiday Jade has organised for me, the 1st was Cook Islands, which was another amazing holiday!
