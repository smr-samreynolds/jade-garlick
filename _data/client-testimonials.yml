      Jade Garlick organised my trip to Thailand. She was very professional and
      nothing was to hard for her to organise. Everything went to plan,
      transfers from airport to hotels and day tours. I would not used anyone
      else to organise my future trips.

      Shout out to the best travel agent around. We have used Jade for multiple
      overseas holidays and have always had the best of experiences. Today Jade
      went above and beyond - we had an issue with our son travelling overseas
      who was looking like missing connections and his trip to Sicily from the
      UK. Jade was able to help him ASAP and get him onto a different airline so
      he didnâ€™t miss a bit of his holiday. Simply outstanding service. Her
      commitment to her clients is above and beyond and the comfort and security
      that comes with having her on your team is second to none. We will not be
      going anywhere else for our travel guidance.
