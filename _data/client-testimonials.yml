      Jade Garlick organised my trip to Thailand. She was very professional and
      nothing was to hard for her to organise. Everything went to plan,
      transfers from airport to hotels and day tours. I would not used anyone
      else to organise my future trips.

      Shout out to the best travel agent around. We have used Jade for multiple
      overseas holidays and have always had the best of experiences. Today Jade
      went above and beyond - we had an issue with our son travelling overseas
      who was looking like missing connections and his trip to Sicily from the
      UK. Jade was able to help him ASAP and get him onto a different airline so
      he didn’t miss a bit of his holiday. Simply outstanding service. Her
      commitment to her clients is above and beyond and the comfort and security
      that comes with having her on your team is second to none. We will not be
      going anywhere else for our travel guidance.

      Jade came highly recommended through many, many people on Facebook groups
      having shared their positive experiences with her. I was a little
      skeptical about using a travel agent at first - having been overseas on a
      number of occasions and usually booking everything myself (thinking it was
      cheaper). However, once I reached out to Jade, I was blown away at her
      knowledge and expertise. But most of all, she put me at ease (I previously
      had a poor experience with a travel agent). I was planning my first ever
      trip to Bali, so guidance and trip ideas was especially important to me -
      Jade had so much advice and information for me to absorb so the best
      holiday for my partner and I could be planned! I could not recommend Jade
      enough, and I can’t wait for my next holiday, so I can utilise Jade’s
      services through Roast & Roam! Thank you so much Jade for helping us plan
      our incredible Dec 2023 Bali holiday!

      Jade organised a trip to Vanuatu for myself and two friends and our
      families! Despite a flight cancellation out of our control, we had the
      best holiday! Leaving all the travel plans in Jades capable hands took all
      the stress away! Jade really did go above and beyond for us and was just a
      phone call away when we had our flight cancelled, my anxiety could have
      been higher but to know Jade was doing what she could behind the scenes
      really helped. This is now the 2nd holiday Jade has organised for me, the
      1st was Cook Islands, which was another amazing holiday!

      Jade organised a lovely date night in Shangri La for my now fiancè and I,
      not only was it the smoothest transaction (because I knew nothing about
      it) but when we got to the room, Jade surprised us both with a room
      upgrade, with breath taking views of the harbour, she had organised late
      check out, wine on arrival, breakfast for two and a voucher for dinner and
      drinks. Thank you Jade, I cannot recommend you enough and I can't wait to
      deal with you in the near future!
