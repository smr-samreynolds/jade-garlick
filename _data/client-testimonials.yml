      Jade Garlick organised my trip to Thailand. She was very professional and
      nothing was to hard for her to organise. Everything went to plan,
      transfers from airport to hotels and day tours. I would not used anyone
      else to organise my future trips.

      Shout out to the best travel agent around. We have used Jade for multiple
      overseas holidays and have always had the best of experiences. Today Jade
      went above and beyond - we had an issue with our son travelling overseas
      who was looking like missing connections and his trip to Sicily from the
      UK. Jade was able to help him ASAP and get him onto a different airline so
      he didn’t miss a bit of his holiday. Simply outstanding service. Her
      commitment to her clients is above and beyond and the comfort and security
      that comes with having her on your team is second to none. We will not be
      going anywhere else for our travel guidance.

      Jade came highly recommended through many, many people on Facebook groups
      having shared their positive experiences with her. I was a little
      skeptical about using a travel agent at first - having been overseas on a
      number of occasions and usually booking everything myself (thinking it was
      cheaper). However, once I reached out to Jade, I was blown away at her
      knowledge and expertise. But most of all, she put me at ease (I previously
      had a poor experience with a travel agent). I was planning my first ever
      trip to Bali, so guidance and trip ideas was especially important to me -
      Jade had so much advice and information for me to absorb so the best
      holiday for my partner and I could be planned! I could not recommend Jade
      enough, and I can’t wait for my next holiday, so I can utilise Jade’s
      services through Roast & Roam! Thank you so much Jade for helping us plan
      our incredible Dec 2023 Bali holiday!
